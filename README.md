# ShopSight Analytics Platform

A next-generation e-commerce analytics platform that transforms product data into actionable business intelligence through AI-powered insights and predictive analytics.

## ðŸš€ Overview

ShopSight delivers a complete analytics experience: **Natural Language Search â†’ Real-time Analytics â†’ AI-Powered Insights**. Built with modern tech stack and advanced AI integration, it demonstrates the future of e-commerce intelligence.

## ðŸ§  Thought Process & Prioritization

### Core Philosophy
Given the 2-hour time constraint, I focused on delivering **one complete, polished user journey** rather than multiple half-finished features. The goal was to create something that could immediately demonstrate value to stakeholders.

### Key Decisions & Rationale

#### 1. **Tech Stack Choice: Python + Next.js**
- **Why**: Fastest path to a working prototype with modern, production-ready technologies
- **Python/FastAPI**: Rapid API development with built-in validation and documentation
- **Next.js/TypeScript**: Component-based UI with excellent developer experience
- **Alternative considered**: Pure Python (Django) - rejected due to slower UI development

#### 2. **Core User Journey: Search â†’ Analytics â†’ AI Insights**
- **Priority 1**: Natural language search (most impressive AI integration)
- **Priority 2**: Visual analytics dashboard (demonstrates data understanding)
- **Priority 3**: AI-powered insights (shows advanced LLM capabilities)
- **Why this order**: Each step builds on the previous, creating a cohesive narrative

#### 3. **LLM Integration Strategy**
- **Primary**: Natural language search (immediate user value)
- **Secondary**: AI insights generation (demonstrates analytical capabilities)
- **Tertiary**: AI agent chat interface (shows advanced interaction patterns)
- **Fallback**: Mock responses when API fails (ensures demo always works)

#### 4. **Data Strategy: Real + Mock Hybrid**
- **Real data**: Sales trends (easiest to implement with realistic patterns)
- **Mock data**: Forecasts and customer segments (complex to implement properly)
- **Why**: Focused development time on user experience rather than data processing

#### 5. **UI/UX Priorities**
- **Clean, professional design**: First impression matters for demos
- **Responsive layout**: Shows attention to modern web standards
- **Loading states**: Demonstrates production-ready thinking
- **Error handling**: Shows robustness and user consideration

#### 6. **What I Chose NOT to Build**
- **Real S3 integration**: Would require AWS setup and data processing
- **Complex forecasting models**: Time-intensive, better to mock convincingly
- **User authentication**: Not core to the analytics value proposition
- **Database persistence**: Adds complexity without demo value

#### 7. **AI Agentic Features (Competitive Advantage)**
- **Interactive chat interface**: Shows advanced LLM integration
- **Proactive suggestions**: Demonstrates AI thinking beyond simple Q&A
- **Confidence scoring**: Shows understanding of AI limitations
- **Contextual responses**: Proves the system understands the domain

### Trade-offs Made

| Decision | Benefit | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| Mock data for forecasts | Fast implementation | Less impressive than real ML |
| Single product focus | Polished experience | Limited product variety |
| Local development only | No deployment complexity | Not production-ready |
| OpenAI API dependency | Advanced AI features | Requires API key setup |

### Success Metrics
